                <h3>Lab 1 - Foundations of the Web </h3>
                <p>In Lab 1 - Foundations of the Web, I learned essential basic aspects of web technologies and
                    programming. This lab consisted of two primary sections: gaining proficiency in the fundamentals of
                    the Web and the HTTP protocol, and participating in basic web application programming.

                    The initial segment involved tasks like getting familar with the Wireshark and the HTTP request and
                    response protocol i.e re, as well as comprehending HTTP through telnet command and Wireshark tool.
                    Through practical exercises, I documented and scrutinized network traffic, applied filters(i.e
                    http), and narrowed down HTTP packets to acquire understanding into request, response methods,
                    parameters, headers, and payload.

                    In the subsequent part, I learned CGI web applications in C and developed a straightforward PHP web
                    application with user input. Responsibilities included creating a Hello World CGI
                    program,(/var/www/html) deploying it on an Apache web server, and comprehending HTTP GET and POST
                    requests. Additionally, I learnt security vulnerabilities in a PHP web application that accepts user
                    input.

                    Throughout this lab, I gained to instructions from the slides of Lecture 3, and all code and
                    documentation were systematically organized in a GitHub repository under the labs/lab1 directory.
                    The hands-on exercises offered practical insights into network analysis, CGI programming, and PHP
                    web development.

                    Overall, the lab enhanced my understanding of foundational web concepts, network analysis tools, and
                    basic web application programming techniques.</p>

                <h3>Lab 2 - Front-end Web Development </h3>
                <p>In the course of Lab 2 - Front-end Web Development, I learned and applied my knowledge by creating a
                    structured HTML file, `waph-devulaar.html.` This file incorporates essential tags and elements,
                    including headers, paragraphs, and forms, demonstrating my proficiency in basic HTML. The inclusion
                    of inline, internal, and external CSS styles showcased versatility in styling, contributing to a
                    visually appealing and well-designed interface. JavaScript functionalities, both inline and
                    external, were seamlessly integrated, introducing dynamic elements such as digital and analog clocks
                    to enhance the HTML design.

                    Additionally, I learned how to effectively utilize Ajax to capture user input, enabling the seamless
                    execution of requests to the 'echo.php' web application. This process facilitated dynamic content
                    updates, resulting in a more responsive user experience. The integration of jQuery played a pivotal
                    role in optimizing asynchronous communication, highlighting concise and efficient coding practices.
                    Furthermore, the web application seamlessly interacted with external APIs, fetching real-time
                    content from sources like JokeAPI and Agify. This hands-on experience not only expanded my technical
                    skills but also emphasized the practical application of web development principles in creating
                    interactive and dynamic web applications.</p>

                <h3>Hackathon 1 - Cross-site Scripting Attacks and Defenses </h3>
                <p>During the first part of our hackathon, I learned about exploring seven levels of reflected
                    cross-site
                    scripting (XSS) attacks. Starting from Level 0, I created basic JavaScript alerts that were embedded
                    in
                    input fields, and escalated to more sophisticated methods like manipulating URL parameters,
                    exploiting
                    form inputs, and evading server-side sanitization techniques. Each level, from 0 to 6, presented a
                    unique challenge, requiring me to think like an attacker and use creative coding to execute scripts
                    that
                    displayed my signature `hacked by Abinay Devulapally` message. These exercises weren't just about
                    breaking things; they were about understanding vulnerabilities at a granular level to build more
                    secure
                    web applications in the future.

                    In Task 2, I am taking steps to strengthen our code against potential security threats. I am
                    currently
                    working with the `echo.php` file from Lab 1, focusing on implementing strict input validation
                    measures
                    and ensuring that any data is accurately encoded to minimize the possibility of attacks.
                    Moreover, while working on our front-end prototype in Lab 2, I am identifying all external data
                    channels
                    and validating and sanitizing the data before it is displayed on the webpage. This is a continuous
                    process of attack and defense, which is helping me understand the significance of both perspectives
                    in
                    cybersecurity. This practical, hands-on approach is not only engaging but also critical in
                    reinforcing
                    best practices for web security.</p>

                <h3>Individual Project 1 </h3>
                <p>To create a comprehensive professional profile, I deployed a personal website on GitHub Pages,
                    including vital details such as my name, a headshot, and contact information. The site features
                    sections detailing my educational background, emphasizing ongoing studies in Information Technology
                    and past achievements in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My professional experiences,
                    notably as a DevOps Engineer at Tata Consultancy and Services, are outlined in the "Experiences"
                    segment, highlighting key responsibilities and contributions in cloud solutions development.

                    A dedicated "Skills" section categorizes my technical expertise, utilizing Vue.js for dynamic
                    content rendering. The website, hosted on GitHub, ensures easy accessibility and deployment,
                    maintaining a professional and user-friendly interface. The site serves as a comprehensive digital
                    resume, presenting a holistic overview of my professional background, experiences, and technical
                    skills.

                    I've also created a 'waph.html' file showcasing an overview of a course introduction, including Lab
                    1, Lab 2, and a Hackathon. For a clean and responsive design, Bootstrap was implemented, integrating
                    stylesheets and components like the navbar, grid system, and cards.

                    For a global touch, a Flag Counter was added, visually representing the diverse locations of
                    visitors. Technical requirements include basic JavaScript code for a dynamic digital and analog
                    clock, as well as the ability to show/hide an email address using Vue.js and jQuery.

                    Two public APIs were integrated: JokeAPI for periodic humorous content updates and Weatherbit API
                    for real-time weather data in Cincinnati. Additionally, GitHub repositories were dynamically fetched
                    and displayed on the website using AJAX and jQuery.

                    Lastly, JavaScript cookies were employed to remember visitors. Returning users are welcomed back
                    with their last visit timestamp, while new visitors receive a warm welcome. The "lastVisit" cookie
                    is set to expire in 30 days, providing a personalized and engaging user experience.</p>
